</div>
<p>On 26 November Victorians will pass judgment on the at times controversial second term of the Andrews Labor government.</p>
<p>First term governments can often deflect problems on to their predecessors and most win re-election. But after eight years in power and seeking a third term, governments are overwhelmingly judged on the good and the bad of their record in office.</p>
<p>When the Andrews government was re-elected in 2018, no one knew that its second term would be dominated by a pandemic. Four years later, Covid's two-year thrall over Victoria is the lens through which many Victorians will view the government's record. </p>
<p>The handling of Covid will haunt the 2022 election campaign. It is an issue that many government members would like to move on from, but many voters find hard to forget. Some voters will be keen for retribution against the government, others just want to move on and see the return to traditional politics.</p>
<p>There are questions raised by the last four years. Did the Andrew's government mis-handle hotel isolation and contact tracing? Why did lockdowns and curfews need to be longer and tougher than in other states? Or did the Andrews government's actions save the state's economy from even  worse damage? </p>
<p>The election won't answer those questions, but it will measure state-wide opinion on whether the Andrews government has performed well enough to be trusted with a third term. If re-elected, the government's return will have been assisted by opposition mis-steps.</p>
<p>Former Liberal Leader Michael O'Brien struggled to both support Covid public health measures while attacking the government for mis-handling the state's Covid response. More aggressive attacks by Liberal frontbencher Tim Smith proved divisive, especially when confused with outside groups attacking mandatory vaccination rules. Matthew Guy returned for a second turn as Liberal leader in 2021.</p>
<p>With questions over the government's record and an Opposition struggling to establish alternative government status, it leaves room for minor parties and independents to play an important role in the election result.</p>
<h2>This Election Guide</h2>
<p>The bulk of this guide consists of background pages on each of the state's 88 lower house districts. Each page covers the history, past results and a listing of candidates in ballot paper order. Candidate profiles with links and pictures will be added progressively for most candidates through the campaign.</p>
<p>There are index pages to help navigate the site, with indexes by electorate name, electorate margin and candidate name, and summaries of key seats and retiring members. The indexes are linked from the top of each guide page, making the site easy to navigate without resorting to Google.</p>
<p>There is also a <a href="lc-preview/index.html">Preview for the Legislative Council</a> which includes links to background on the contest in each region, and a <a href="gvt-index.html">Legislative Council voting guid</a>e which includes links to the registered group voting tickets (GVTs). There is also a <a href="calculator-upper.html">Legislative Council Calculator</a> that applies GVTs to entered votes and predicts the winning candidates.</p>
<p>On election night, and in the weeks that follow, the site will provide a full results service. The results service includes the unique feature of the Legislative Council Calculator to predict the upper house result.</p>

<h2>Covid and Recent Elections</h2>
</summary>
<p>At the height of Covid, voters rewarded incumbent governments with re-election in the ACT, Northern Territory, Queensland, Tasmania and most spectacularly in Western Australia.</p>
<p>With the two worst years of Covid lockdowns now passed, the electoral mood in 2022 seems to have switched from rewarding governments to punishing them.</p>
<p>In March 2022 the Marshall Liberal government in South Australia was defeated after its re-election campaign coincided with the state's first serious Covid outbreak. Then it was the turn of the Morrison government to be defeated at the Federal election in May.</p>
<p>Will November's Victorian election be about reward or punishment? The period when fear was the emotion controlling public reaction to Covid restrictions has passed. Given how long and tough the Victorian lockdowns were, and how many people's livelihoods and lifestyles were damaged, resentment will be the reaction of some voters.</p>
<p>Perceptions of how the Andrews government handled Covid will vary greatly depending on each voter's personal circumstances. Many voters were in a position where they could work from home. Others had their livelihoods ruined with small businesses closed and their employees out of work. People in insecure employment had little to fall back on.</p>
<p>Census data suggests that those most impacted by Covid, in terms of both health and wealth, live overwhelmingly in Labor seats. Voters in middle class seats were more likely to be in occupations where working from home was easier. The clusters of trade workers in outer suburban seats found their  businesses locked out of travelling for work. Will this hurt Labor in outer suburban seats not normally viewed as competitive?</p>
<p>The last term of government has created a more polarised electorate, but disenchantment with the Andrews government may not translate into Coalition gains. Recent Victorian political history and geography suggest it will be difficult for the Coalition to win the 2022 election. There was little encouragement for the Victorian Liberal Party in May's Federal election result.</p>
<p>Both parties have had internal problems since 2018. Labor was shaken by rampant branch stacking, which combined with ministerial exhaustion post-Covid, sees the government lose a large slice of frontbench talent at the 2022 election. The Liberal Party has seen the departure and return of Matthew Guy as Leader. There have also been disputes over pre-selection and the party's own version of branch stacking. Liberal frontbencher Tim Smith attracted controversy with his attacks on the Andrews government over its handling of Covid. He attracted even more controversy as Shadow Attorney General when he crashed his car and was convicted of drink driving. Smith is not contesting the 2022 election.</p>
<p>But saying that the Coalition will struggle to win does not mean the Andrews government is headed for an easy victory. There are enough seats where the government will suffer significant swings against it to suggest the government cannot stroll back into office, whatever the polls say.</p>
<p>The uneven impact of Covid could produce an equally uneven pattern of swings. Labor saw a significant rise in Independent vote in some of its safest Melbourne seats in 2018. Inflation and rising interest rates may cause Melbourne's mortgage belt to be more important than it has been at recent elections.</p>
<p>The Coalition can take seats from Labor. Labor could also lose safe seats to Greens and independents. Taken together these probably won't be enough to defeat the Andrews government, but it leaves minority Labor government as a possible outcome.</p>

<h2>Going for a Third Term</h2>
</summary>
<p>In seeking a third term on 26 November, Daniel Andrews will be hoping to emulate two of his Labor predecessors, John Cain Junior and Steve Bracks, who both won three elections. If he loses after two terms, there will be a less flattering comparison with former Liberal Premier Jeff Kennett.</p>
<p>Labor has won eight of the last 11 Victorian elections and governed the state for 29 of the last 40 years. It is a far cry from the state's history before 1982 when Labor governments were rare and brief. Over four decades, Victoria has gone from the 'jewel in the Liberal crown' to being the 'Massachusetts of Australia politics'.</p>
<p>The Victorian Liberal Party suffered a heavy defeat in 2018, and had an equally bad result at May's Federal election. The Liberal Party lost the federal seats of Higgins and Chisholm to Labor and the heartland seats of Kooyong and Goldstein to 'teal' independents.</p>
<p>The 'teals' will again be an issue for the Liberal Party at the state election, but Labor faces its own problems with Independents in its safe seats.</p>
<p>A redistribution since the last election has continued the trend of recent decades where seats in Liberal voting eastern Melbourne have been abolished and replaced by new seats in Labor voting areas west of the Yarra. It is a trend eating away at Melbourne's stock of safe Liberal seats. (<a href="redistribution.html">You can read a summary of the redistribution here</a>)</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Labor has had a lock on regional seats in western Victoria since the defeat of the Kennett government in 1999, and the Liberal Party hasn't won a Metropolitan seat north or west of the Yarra this century. If Labor can keep its lock on both areas, and win enough seats down the spine of south-east Melbourne, then Labor can retain office even if the Coalition recovers the eastern Melbourne seats lost in 2018.</p>
<p>The threat to Labor west of the Yarra could come from Independents. After eight years in office and delays in road, rail and health infrastructure, Independents championing the west have emerged in seats like Melton, Werribee and Point Cook. There are also huge candidate numbers with 14 in Melton and 15 in Point Cook and Werribee. Results could be influenced by a rise in informal voting and the vagaries of ballot paper order.</p>
<p> Labor also faces a threat in inner Melbourne where the Greens hope to double their representation. These hopes have been boosted by the Liberal Party's decision to put Labor behind the Greens on all how-to-votes and to campaign with a &quot;Put Labor Last&quot; slogan.</p>
<p>The  Coalition winning government in its own right appears unlikely given the swing needed, but the prospect of the Andrews government losing its majority remains a live option.</p>

<h2>The Swings Needed</h2>
</summary>
<p>Labor won 55 of the 88 seats in Legislative Assembly at the 2018 election, double the Coalition's 27 seats (21 Liberals, six Nationals). Three Greens and three Independents were also elected.</p>
<p>The starting point for the 2022 election has been changed by retirements and a redistribution. While there are different interpretations of the new numbers, the ABC's starting point is Labor on 56 seats, the Coalition 27 (21 Liberals, 6 Nationals), three Greens and two Independents. (<a href="redistribution.html">You can read more about the redistribution here.</a>) </p>
<p>Majority government requires 45 seats, giving government 44 of 87 seats on the Assembly floor and the ability to determine who fills the powerful Speaker's position.</p>
<p>The Coalition took office after the 2010 election with a tenuous majority holding 45 seats to Labor's 43 seats and no crossbench. The later resignation of backbencher Geoff Shaw from the Liberal Party left the Napthine government with only 43 secure votes on the Assembly floor. The government found itself unable to control the business of the Assembly in a way that would once have brought on an early election. The loss of Shaw's vote paralysed the government, but Labor would not use his vote to bring down the government and invoke the procedures to change government or bring on an early election.</p>
<p>The problems of the Napthine government revealed a weakness in the state's fixed term parliament rules. The rules were designed to prevent strong governments calling early elections. It hadn't been anticipated that a weak government could be trapped in office if no alternative government were available and the Opposition declined to bring the government down.</p>
<p>The two elections since have produced clearer outcomes with Labor winning in 2014 with 47 seats, and re-elected with 55 in 2018. There were also three crossbenchers elected in 2014 and six in 2018. It is likely that crossbench numbers will increase at the 2022 election.</p>
<p>If neither side of politics wins 45 seats, the crossbench will have a role in determining who forms government. Traditionally the side of politics with more seats has the better chance of forming government in a hung parliament. But not always.</p>
<p>In 1999 the Bracks government took office with 42 seats against 43 for the soon to split Coalition, the three crossbench independents choosing to back Labor. The Bracks government later reached majority via by-elections, though maintained a close association with the crossbench.</p>
<p>Given the presence of the Greens in the Assembly, it is unlikely that the Coalition could form minority government if Labor plus the Greens had a combined majority. The maths of who forms government would become more complex if both the Greens and Independents were required for Labor to govern, or there were enough Independents to allow the Coalition to govern.</p>
<p>The decline in the number of two-party preferred contests and the presence of the crossbench complicates trying to define the swings needed for government. Assuming two-party preferred swings, here are some scenarios for the swing needed -</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><strong>7.1% for Labor to retain majority</strong>  - Labor could lose 11 seats to the Coalition and still retain majority government, assuming no gains by the crossbench.</li>
<li><strong>10.5% for a Coalition majority</strong>  - the Coalition need to gain 18 seats from Labor for majority government, assuming no changes on the crossbench.</li>
<li><strong>10.2% for the Coalition to have more seats than Labor</strong>  - if the Coalition gain 15 seats from Labor, they would finish with more seats, again assuming no change on the crossbench.</li>
<li><strong>10.2% for a Labor plus Greens Majority</strong>  - Labor and the Greens hold a combined 59 seats. Even if the Greens take seats from Labor, it will take a combined loss of 14 seats for the two parties to lose their majority.</li>
<li><strong>For no Overall Majority</strong> - If Labor loses seats to the Greens or Independents, then the swing for Labor to lose its overall majority is less than 7.1%. Losses to independents would also reduce the swing needed to deprive Labor and the Greens of a joint majority. Every seat the Coalition loses to an Independent or Green increases the swing meeded for the Coalition to achieve majority government or finish with more seats than Labor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given past antipathy between Labor and the Greens, Labor may prefer to govern in minority rather than arrange a formal governing arrangement with the Greens. As has happened previously in the Legislative Council, Labor would find it easier to govern in minority if there were enough Independents to create an alternative pathway to control the chamber and pass legislation.</p>

<h2>The 2018 Election</h2>
</summary>
<p>A vigorous campaign by the Opposition on law and order, combined with opinion polls indicating a  close result, suggested it would take a while to to determine the winner on election night in 2018.</p>
<p>Instead the result was clear within an hour. By 7:15pm the ABC was able to call the re-election of the Andrews government with a substantial increase in its majority. The rest of the evening was given over to assessing the scale of damage for the Coalition.</p>
<p>Among the Liberal losses was senior frontbencher John Pesutto, who had the misfortune of being on the ABC's election night panel as it became apparent he would lose his seat of Hawthorn. It took a week of counting to confirm his defeat, but the swing in Hawthorn was repeated in a string of traditional Liberal seats in Melbourne's east and inner south-east. The presumed tight contest turned into a rout.</p>

<p>The two-party preferred swing to Labor was 6.2% in metropolitan Melbourne, 5.5% in regional cities and 3.1% in country Victoria. The swing to Labor was 4.6% west and north of the Yarra, 6.3% in eastern Melbourne and 7.5% in Melbourne's south-east. Labor's four most marginal seats, spread along the Frankston rail line, all recorded swings to Labor of more than 9%. The result was worse for the Coalition than suggested by the pre-election pendulum because the swing to Labor was strongest in marginal seats.</p>
<p>The seats that changed party were  -</p>
<ul class="list">
	<li>Labor gained six seats from the Liberals in Melbourne's east - Bayswater, Box Hill, Burwood, Hawthorn, Mount Waverley and Ringwood.</li>
	<li>Labor also gained Bass on Melbourne's outer south-east fringe, Nepean on the tip of the Mornington Peninsula, and South Barwon based on southern Geelong and the Surf Coast.</li>
	<li>In a swap of seats, Labor lost Brunswick to the Greens but regained neighbouring Northcote, lost by Labor at a November 2017 by-election.</li>
	<li>Independent Ali Cupper defeated the Nationals in Mildura.</li>
	<li>Originally elected as a National Party candidate, Russell Northe was re-elected contesting his seat of Morwell as an Independent.</li>

<h2>Victoria's Political Geography</h2>
</summary>
<p>Labor's success in winning eight of the 11 elections since 1982 has removed from memory the preceding decades of Liberal dominance and Labor electoral failure. When John Cain Junior led Labor to victory at the 1982 state election, it was only the second time the state had elected a majority Labor government. When Cain won a second victory in 1985, his was the first Victorian Labor government to win re-election.</p>
<p>Victoria has had four changes of government since the 1982 election. The first was Labor's emphatic ejection from office in 1992, a second the upset defeat to the Kennett government in 1999. After 11 years of the Bracks and Brumby Labor governments, the third and fourth changes in 2010 and 2014 bookended a one-term interlude for the Coalition under Ted Baillieu and Denis Napthine.</p>
<p>Each of these changes of government reveal key features of the electoral geography of Victoria, and in particular Melbourne. They provide pointers to where the 2022 Victorian election will be decided.</p>
<p>Outside of Melbourne, electorates can be split into predominantly rural seats, and a cluster of more urban regional seats based on Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong, along with the Latrobe Valley seats of Narracan and Morwell.</p>
<p>Inside Melbourne, Labor dominates the areas north and west of the Yarra. The Liberal Party’s homeland has always been the swathe of middle-class seats sweeping up into the Dandenongs between the Yarra River and the Monash Freeway. There is an adjoining patch of inner south-east Liberal of seats wedged between the Monash and Port Phillip Bay.</p>
<p>Beyond the inner south-east runs a varied collection of seats extending to Point Nepean and Pakenham. The Liberal Party generally do better along the bay, Labor in the 'sandbelt' wedge running to industrial areas around Dandenong, and there is an ever expanding fringe of seats based on new housing on the south-east edge of the metropolitan area.</p>
<p>For four decades, the growth pattern of Melbourne has seen Liberal voting eastern Melbourne lose seats while Labor voting Melbourne north and west of the Yarra has gained seats. There has also been a slow shift of seats from inner to outer Melbourne, especially in the  city's south-east.</p>
<p>As Melbourne has sprawled ever outward, providing services to the new housing estates on the expanding south-east fringe of Melbourne has tended to dominate state politics. That has certainly been the case at the last three state elections.</p>
<p>Looking back to the 1980s, Labor's push into the Liberal Party's eastern Melbourne heartland put the Cain government into office in 1982. Labor's narrow re-elections in 1985 and 1988 were built on holding enough seats in Melbourne's east to achieve a majority. That ended when Labor lost every seat in the east on the defeat of the Kirner government in 1992.</p>
<p>Labor's victory over Jeff Kennett in 1999  has left an imprint on every election since. It may seem ancient history in 2022, but Labor’s victory had two important consequences. One was on perceptions of Labor's ability to govern, the second on how Labor wins Victorian elections.</p>
<p>First, after two terms of tough economic reform, the Kennett government’s loss handed the keys of office to Labor just as the early 2000s economic boom began. There have been some questions since over the Kennett government's legacy in the public sector, but few have questioned his government’s record in cutting debt and making the state's economy more competitive. But defeat in 1999 deprived the Coalition of governing in the good times that its hard years had helped create. The good times fell into Labor's lap.</p>
<p>The second impact of the 1999 election was to entrench Labor in a string of regional seats. Twenty-three years after the 1999 election, Labor continues to hold the four Ballarat and Bendigo seats along with Geelong and Macedon. Labor has held Bellarine continuously since 2002 and also has a good record of winning South Barwon and Ripon. Labor rarely held more than two or three non-metropolitan seats before 1999.</p>
<p>The 1999 election was also the last time the Liberal Party won a Melbourne seat north or west of the Yarra. The Liberal Party won four seats in the region in 1992, lost Essendon and Ivanhoe in 1996, Tullamarine in 1999, and Eltham in 2002. The Liberal Party has not won a metropolitan seat north or west of the Yarra this century.</p>
<p>Holding so many regional seats means that Labor no longer needs to win seats in eastern Melbourne  to achieve government. Labor won only a single seat in eastern Melbourne in 1999, only a single eastern seat when the Brumby government lost office in 2010, and again only one on the election of the Andrews government in 2014.</p>
<p>Labor won seven eastern Melbourne seats in 2018, reduced to five by the redistribution. In 2022 the Liberal Party needs to recover these seats, as well as defend a string of its own seats on tiny margins in eastern Melbourne, and also in the wedge of seats between the Monash and Port Phillip Bay.</p>
<p>So many seats at play makes these Liberal areas look like a key battleground. They aren't. Even if the Liberal Party recovers its crown jewels in the east and along the bay, Labor would still hold more seats than the Coalition.</p>
<p>It is better to look at the closely fought 2010 and 2014 elections to see where Victorian elections are decided. The Frankston Line seats of Bentleigh, Mordialloc, Carrum and Frankston put the Baillieu government into office in 2010 and defeated the Napthine government in 2014. The problem for the Coalition in 2022 is that these seats saw some of the biggest swings to Labor in 2018. The Liberal Party need to generate equally large swings in its favour to be in contention for government in 2022. The same comment applies to nearby areas of the south-east, now in the seats of Cranbourne, Hastings, Berwick, Pakenham and Bass. </p>
<p>There are areas north and west of the Yarra that are growing as quickly as the south-east and where Labor may suffer in 2022. A new crossing of the Yarra to improve road access has yet to be completed. Improving western rail services means untangling access to Southern Cross station and expanding the existing rail network. These tasks are more complex and more expensive than the improvements achieved in south-east Melbourne by removing level crossings.</p>
<p>The question is, who benefits if Labor loses support in its western heartland? The Liberal Party has a poor electoral record in the west. Can it do better or will Independents be a greater threat to Labor? Can the Coalition win the election, or is the Andrews government losing its majority the best outcome the Coalition can achieve?</p>

<h2>Where the Election will be Decided</h2>

<summary>
<h2>The Fate of the Liberal Party's Jewels</h2>
</summary>
<p>As bad as the 2018 election was for the Liberal Party, it could have been worse. Thirteen of the party's 21 seats were left dangling at the bottom of the electoral pendulum on margins under 3%. Going into the 2022 election, the Liberal Party's safest metropolitan  seat is Malvern on just 6.0%.</p>
<p>Before the Coalition can challenge Labor for government, the Liberal Party must first recover and secure its 'crown jewels', the band of traditional Liberal seats that run from Beaumaris north to Kew and then into the eastern suburbs.</p>
<p>Four of the seats of greatest interest lie in the Federal seats of Goldstein and Kooyong, gained by 'teal' independents at May's Federal election. In Kooyong, Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg was defeated by Independent Dr Monique Ryan, while Goldstein saw Zoe Daniel defeat Tim Wilson.</p>
<p><a href="kew/index.html"><strong>Kew (<span class="ptyblue">LIB 4.7%</span>)</strong></a> covers the northern part of Kooyong and has long been one of Melbourne's 'establishment' seats represented by Premiers and senior frontbenchers. The Liberal Party faces two problems. First, departing Liberal MP Tim Smith was controversial for his attacks on the Andrews government's handling of Covid, and for his personal humiliation over a car accident and drink driving conviction. Second, 'teal' success in Kooyong has spawned a strong Independent in Sophie Torney, a businesswoman and daughter of eminent Liberal Party historian Ian Hancock. New Liberal candidate Jess Wilson previously worked for the Business Council and for Josh Frydenberg. The Liberal Party need Wilson to win.</p>
<p>The southern half of Kooyong covers another traditional Liberal seat in <a href="hawt/index.html"><strong>Hawthorn (<span class="ptyred">ALP 0.6%</span>)</strong></a>. It provided a dramatic upset in 2018 when little known Labor candidate John Kennedy defeated senior Liberal frontbencher John Pesutto. The drama was heightened by Pesutto being on the ABC's election night panel as the story of his defeat unfolded. Pesutto is re-contesting and has a considerably higher profile courtesy of his very public defeat. Unknown in 2018 and living in a retirement village, few give Kennedy much chance of a repeat win in 2022. The seat has also attracted a high-profile 'teal' independent in Melissa Lowe.</p>	
<p>Within Goldstein are the bayside Liberal seats of <a href="brig/index.html"><strong>Brighton (<span class="ptyblue">LIB 0.5%</span>)</strong></a> and <a href="sand/index.html"><strong>Sandringham (<span class="ptyblue">LIB 0.4%</span>)</strong></a>. Brighton was first contested in 1856 and has never left the Liberal fold. Sandringham was first contested in 1955 and only once been won by Labor. Both seats had retiring members in 2018 and came close to being lost to 'no-name' Labor candidates. The first term Liberal MPs are James Newbury in Brighton and Brad Rowswell in Sandringham. Labor's candidates are Louise Crawford in Brighton and Bettina Prescott in Sandringham. Newbury withstood a pre-selection challenge from former Bayside Council Mayor Felicity Frederico. She has chosen to renew the battle by nominating as an Independent.</p>
<p> To begin a list of must win seats with the Liberal bastions of Brighton, Hawthorn, Kew and Sandringham shows the scale of the 2018 defeat. It gets worse when the fifth seat listed is <a href="caul/index.html"><strong>Caulfield (<span class="ptyblue">LIB 0.04%</span>)</strong></a>. Caufield has never been won by Labor since it was first contested in 1927 and is currently held by Liberal Deputy Leader David Southwick. Post-redistribution it is not entirely clear that Caufield still has a Liberal majority. He faces a challenge in 2022 from two with strong opponents in Labor's Lior Harel and Independent Nomi Kaltmann. All three candidates are of Jewish faith, Caulfield having by far the state's highest proportion of Jewish residents.</p>
<p>Further east, <a href="bays/index.html"><strong>Bayswater (*) (<span class="ptyblue">LIB 0.6%</span>)</strong></a> has undergone significant boundary changes. It was won by Labor in 2018, but has been merged with the abolished neighbouring Liberal seat of Ferntree Gully. The new Bayswater has roughly equal numbers from both former seats and will be contested by two sitting members, Bayswater's Labor MP Jackson Taylor, and Liberal MP Nick Wakeling, who has represented Ferntree Gully since 2006. Another MP defending a re-named seat is Forest Hill MP Neil Angus, the seat he has represented since 2010 re-formed as <a href="glen/index.html"><strong>Glen Waverley (<span class="ptyblue">LIB 0.9%</span>)</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Unless there is a significant swing to Labor in 2022, the Liberal Party should be safe in other outer north-east Melbourne seats. These includes  David Hodgett in <a href="croy/index.html"><strong>Croydon (<span class="ptyblue">LIB 1.0%</span>)</strong></a>, Cindy McLeish in <a href="eild/index.html"><strong>Eildon (<span class="ptyblue">LIB 1.0%</span>)</strong></a> and Bridget Vallence in <a href="evel/index.html"><strong>Evelyn (<span class="ptyblue">LIB 1.8%</span>)</strong></a>.</p>
<p>If the Liberal Party can win all the seats listed above, its next task is to expel the region's three Labor MPs. <a href="ashw/index.html"><strong>Ashwood (<span class="ptyred">ALP 2.0%</span>)</strong></a> is a new name on the state's electoral map but largely a replacement for the merged Labor seats of Burwood and Mount Waverley. Ashwood will be contested by Matt Fregon, Labor's member for Mount Waverley, while Burwood's Labor MP Will Fowles moves further east to contest <a href="ring/index.html"><strong>Ringwood (<span class="ptyred">ALP 3.2%</span>)</strong></a>, surprisingly Labor's safest seat in eastern Melbourne. Between these two is <a href="boxh/index.html"><strong>Box Hill (<span class="ptyred">ALP 3.1%</span>)</strong></a>, a relatively safe Liberal seat for most of the last two decades and  another surprise Labor gain in 2018 when won by Paul Hamer.</p>
<p>The 13 seats listed above lie in traditional Liberal territory. They are not the real battleground of the election as a Liberal clean-sweep would only produce a gain four seats. Another 14 are needed for government, and for them the Liberal Party must look further afield.</p>
</details>

<summary>
<h2>Outer South-East Melbourne</h2>
</summary>
<p>After featuring prominently at the last three Victorian elections, the Frankston Line four-pack recorded swings of more than 9% towards Labor in 2018, leaving <a href="bent/index.html"><strong>Bentleigh (<span class="ptyred">ALP 11.5%</span>)</strong></a>, <a href="mord/index.html"><strong>Mordialloc (<span class="ptyred">ALP 13.4%</span>)</strong></a>, <a href="carr/index.html"><strong>Carrum (<span class="ptyred">ALP 12.0%</span>)</strong></a> and <a href="fran/index.html"><strong>Frankston (<span class="ptyred">ALP 10.2%</span>)</strong></a> around the top of the swing needed for the Coalition to win the election. Few are predicting the Liberal Party will recover them, but Carrum and Frankston in particular may see substantial swings.</p>
<p>Another rail seat but on a different line is <a href="cran/index.html"><strong>Cranbourne (<span class="ptyred">ALP 9.3%</span>)</strong></a>, which also recorded a big swing to Labor in 2018. It differs in being a rapidly growing seat with acres of new housing where services are struggling to keep up with population growth. It also has one of Melbourne's highest concentrations of small business owners and managers, a group badly hit by pandemic lockdowns. Labor's Pauline Richards was first elected in 2018 and her Liberal opponent is Jagdeep Singh.</p>
<p><a href="nano/index.html"><strong>Narre Warren North (<span class="ptyred">ALP 10.4%</span>)</strong></a> is on a swing that if reached puts the Coalition close to majority government. Labor is disadvantaged by the retirement of two-decade veteran Luke Donnellan, forced to resign from the ministry over branch stacking. The seat covers Endeavour Hills, Hallam and Narre Warren and the new Labor candidate is Belinda Wilson, her Liberal opponent Timothy Dragan. Narre Warren North is one of Melbourne's fringe seats that were badly affected by movement restrictions during the Covid lockdowns.</p>
<p>Huge over-enrolment in the former seats of Gembrook and Bass has seen major boundary changes with Gembrook abolished and two new seats created, Berwick and Pakenham. The cascade of consequent boundary changes has flipped Bass from Labor to Liberal while Hastings has had its Liberal majority wiped out.</p>
<p><a href="berw/index.html"><strong>Berwick (<span class="ptyblue">LIB 1.3%</span>)</strong></a> last existed the 1990s but was abolished in 2002. Population growth in Melbourne's outer south-east has seen it re-created for the 2022 election, taking in around 21,000 voters from the western end of Gembrook, 16,000 from Narre Warren South, and 10,500 voters in Clyde North from Bass. Berwick will be contested by Gembrook Liberal MP and Shadow Police Minister Brad Battin. His Labor opponent Mailk Zaveer will struggle to win.</p>
<p><a href="pake/index.html"><strong>Pakenham (<span class="ptyred">ALP 2.2%</span>)</strong></a> is another former seat re-created for the 2022 election. It covers the advancing front of new housing estates on Melbourne's south-east edge. It takes in  Officer and Pakenham, previously divided between Bass and Gembrook. Based on 2018 results Pakenham has a notional Labor majority but will not be defended by a sitting Labor MP. The competing candidates are Labor's Emma Vulin and Liberal David Farrelly. This is a must win seat for the Liberal Party.</p>
<p><a href="bass/index.html"><strong>Bass (*) (<span class="ptyblue">LIB 0.7%</span>)</strong></a> is the first predominantly rural electorate south-east of Melbourne though its north-western corner includes parts of rapidly growing Clyde. It runs around the northern and eastern shores of Western Port Bay and extends to Phillip Island, Wonthaggi and Inverloch. Bass was won by Labor's Jordan Crugnale in 2018, but the carving out of Pakenham from the seat's northern edge has transformed Bass into a notional Liberal seat. Crugnale's Liberal opponent is Aaron Brown, whose father Alan Brown represented areas covered by Bass between 1979 to 1996. The National candidate is Brett Tessari. Bass is a must win/retain seat for the Liberal Party.</p>
<p>On the western shore of Western Port Bay lies <a href="hast/index.html"><strong>Hastings (<span class="ptyblue">LIB 0.0%</span>)</strong></a> It runs from Langwarrin in the north, through Somerville, Tyabb and Hastings to Crib Point, Balnarring and Somers in the south. The redistribution has virtually wiped out the Liberal majority, and the Liberal Party is further disadvantaged by the retirement of sitting MP Neale Burgess. The new Liberal candidate is Briony Hutton, her Labor opponent former dancer and actor Paul Mercurio. Three decades ago, Mercurio played the lead character Scott Hastings in the hit Australian movie 'Strictly Ballroom', though his real name appearing on ballot papers rules out a 'Hasting for Hastings' campaign. Another must win seat for the Liberal Party.</p>
<p><a href="nepe/index.html"><strong>Nepean (<span class="ptyred">ALP 0.7%</span>)</strong></a> covers the western tip of the Mornington Peninsula and runs along the southern shore of Port Phillip Bay from Safety Beach through Dromana, Rosebud, Rye, Sorrento and Portsea to Point Nepean. If Kew and Hawthorn are Liberal establishment seats, then Nepean is where the establishment have their beach houses. Nepean delivered an upset in 2018 when Labor's Chris Brayne, a candidate few Labor spokespeople could name, emerged victorious. The Liberal Party has chosen a high-profile candidate to try and recover Nepean in journalist and former professional tennis player Sam Groth.</p>
<p>Finally there is <a href="morn/index.html"><strong>Mornington (<span class="ptyblue">LIB 5.0%</span>)</strong></a>, which covers the peninsula suburbs of Mount Eliza, Mornington, Mount Martha and Moorooduc. Liberal MP David Morris is retiring after being defeated for pre-election by former Federal MP for Frankston-based Dunkley, Chris Crewther. In a seat where the Liberal Party is under little threat from Labor, a new challenger has emerged in Climate 200 endorsed 'teal' Independent Dr Kate Lardner.</p>

<h2>Inner-City Green Contests</h2>
</summary>
<p>The inner-city seats  surrounding the Melbourne CBD have been transformed demographically over the last two decades. The decline in Australia's manufacturing industries, and the departure of the remaining manufacturers to greenfield sites elsewhere has changed the population of inner-Melbourne. Formerly working-class neighbourhoods have been gentrified, apart from the remaining public housing blocks. The areas now have populations with well above average levels of university education and professional employment.</p>
<p>Once working class Labor bastions  are now marginal seats, though the district's new arrivals do not vote Liberal. Instead this band of inner-city seats have become contests on the left between Labor and the Greens. And election after election, the Greens have been making gains.</p>
<p>The Greens currently hold three  seats, and the party's chances of making gains have been boosted by the Liberal Party's decision to preference the Greens ahead of Labor. It increases the chances of the Greens  winning the balance of power in the Legislative Assembly.</p>
<p>The Greens will hold <a href="melb/index.html"><strong>Melbourne (<span class="ptylightgreen">GRN 1.6% v ALP</span>)</strong></a> and <a href="brun/index.html"><strong>Brunswick (<span class="ptylightgreen">GRN 2.0% v ALP</span>)</strong></a>. The party's third seat, <a href="prah/index.html"><strong>Prahran (<span class="ptylightgreen">GRN 9.0% v LIB</span>)</strong></a>, looks safer with the Liberal decision on preferences. Prahran is more socially mixed and has a higher Liberal vote than other seats in the region. It is the state's smallest electorate at just 10.9 square kilometres and has been won by the  Greens' Sam Hibbins from third place at the last two elections. Both times he eked out victory by first passing Labor on lower placed candidate preferences to reach second place, then passing the Liberal candidate on Labor preferences. The only threat to Hibbins in 2022 would have been the Liberals slipping to third place,but the change in Liberal preferences means Hibbins should win easily.</p>
<p><a href="nort/index.html"><strong>Northcote (<span class="ptyred">ALP 1.7% v GRN</span>)</strong></a> includes the inner northern suburbs of Northcote, Fairfield, Alphington, Thornbury and parts of Preston. Labor lost Northcote to the Greens at a 2017 by-election following the death of popular MP Fiona Richardson, but the seat was recovered for Labor by Kat Theophanous at the 2018 state election. The Green candidate at the 2022 election is Campbell Gome and his prospects of victory are strong.</p>
<a href="rich/index.html"><strong>Richmond (<span class="ptyred">ALP 5.8% v GRN</span>)</strong></a> is the state's second smallest electorate at just 12.5 square kilometres and takes in Clifton Hill, Fitzroy, Collingwood, Abbotsford, Richmond, Cremorne and Burnley. Labor has scrambled to victory over the Greens in Richmond for the last two decades, but will be disadvantaged in 2022 by the retirement of long serving MP Richard Wynne. The new Labor candidate is Lauren O'Dwyer, while the Greens' candidate is Yarra City Councillor Gabrielle de Vietri. The Liberal Party did not contest Richmond in 2018 and the party's candidate in 2022 is Lucas Moon. This will be a tough seat for Labor to hold.
<p>On paper <a href="albe/index.html"><strong>Albert Park (<span class="ptyred">ALP 13.1%</span>)</strong></a> is a safe Labor seat, but the contest has been opened up by the retirement of veteran MP and former Health Minister Martin Foley. The new Labor candidate is Southern Metropolitan MLC Nina Taylor, opposed by Liberal Lauren Sherson and Greens candidate Kim Samiotis. The Greens usually finish third in Albert Park but outpolled the Liberals in the seat based on May's Federal results. If repeated at the state election, then there is a chance that Liberal preferences could elect the Greens if the party can close the first preference gap on Labor.</p>
<p>In two other seats, a higher proportion of working class migrant voters keeps Labor's first preference vote at a level that won't see the second placed Greens win <a href="pres/index.html"><strong>Preston (<span class="ptyred">ALP 21.2% v GRN</span>)</strong></a> or <a href="foot/index.html"><strong>Footscray (<span class="ptyred">ALP 28.7%</span>)</strong></a>. <a href="pasc/index.html"><strong>Pascoe Vale (<span class="ptyred">ALP 22.3%</span>)</strong></a> could also switch to a Labor-Green contest for the first time.</p>

<summary>
<h2>Western Suburbs</h2>
</summary>
<p>After the redistribution there are 28 metropolitan seats north and west of the Yarra. Two are currently held by the Greens and 26 by Labor, including 17 on margins greater than 15%. There is only one Labor seat in the region on a margin under 5%, and the Liberal Party has not won a seat north or west of the Yarra since the turn of the century.</p>
<p>While the Liberal Party looks unlikely to make a breakthrough in the region, there are several seats where Labor is under threat from Independents.</p>
<p>The first is <a href="melt/index.html"><strong>Melton (<span class="ptyred">ALP 5.0%</span>)</strong></a>, a rapidly growing metropolitan area of its own separated from the rest of western Melbourne's sprawling housing estates. Melton is the only seat in Melbourne to have swung against Labor at the last two elections. Improvment in local services has fallen short of public expectations, population growth and election promises. Labor MP Steve McGhie's first election in 2018 was helped by 12 candidates being on the ballot paper, splitting the anti-Labor vote. This time there are 14 candidates, but Independent Dr Ian Birchall has a higher profile than when he contested in 2018. On the new boundaries Birchall would would have come close to victory in 2018 and is a major threat to Labor in 2022. The Liberal candidate is an experienced campaigner in former Burwood MP Graham Watt, who now lives in Melton.</p>
<p><a href="poin/index.html"><strong>Point Cook (<span class="ptyred">ALP 12.8%</span>)</strong></a> is the new name for Altona where former Attorney-General Jill Hennessy is retiring. This is also a  rapidly growing district, this time in the Wyndham council area in south west Melbourne. The new Labor candidate is Mat Hilakari who is relatively new to the district. The Liberal candidate is Angela Newhouse, but the greater threat to Labor may be Independent Dr Joe Garra. He polled strongly in neighbouring Werribee in 2018, but new boundaries mean he now lives in Point Cook. Garra has a higher profile in 2022 due to regular media appearances during Covid. Garra has drawn badly in being placed last in a field of 15 candidates.</p>
<p>Neighbouring <a href="werr/index.html"><strong>Werribee (<span class="ptyred">ALP 9.2% v IND</span>)</strong></a> is also based in Wyndham Council. The area has been represented by Treasurer Tim Pallas since 2006, but his margin was cut by Independent challenger Dr Joe Garra in 2018. Garra is contesting Point Cook  in 2022, but Pallas still faces a serious challenge. Liberal candidate Mia Shaw is in her second term on Wyndham City Council and has previously served as Mayor. She might have run as an Independent had she not been recruited by the Liberal Party. The Independent that has emerged is Paul Hopper. He runs a chain of successful car dealerships across Melbourne's west and south-west. Pallas has been helped by drawing top spot on a ballot paper of 15 candidates.</p>

<h2>Away from Melbourne</h2>
</summary>
<p>The result of the election will be decided in metropolitan Melbourne, but there are a number of rural and regional seats worth watching.</p>
<p><a href="ripo/index.html"><strong>Ripon (*) (<span class="ptyred">ALP 2.7%</span>)</strong></a> lies to the west of Ballarat and Bendigo. Its major centres are Creswick, Ararat, Maryborough, Avoca, Wedderburn, Skipton, Bridgewater and St Arnaud. Ripon was one of Labor surprise gains in 1999 and was held for Labor by Joe Helper until his retirement in 2014 when current Liberal MP Louise Staley was elected. She survived the 2018 election by only 15 votes after a re-count and has since had her margin wiped out by the redistribution. While she needs a 2.7% swing to her for re-election, Staley is favoured to win against her  Labor opponent Martha Haylett.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/sobo/"><strong>South Barwon (<span class="ptyred">ALP 3.0</span>)</strong></a> covers the southern parts of the Greater Geelong council area, generally south of the Barwon River. It previously extended furthern south into the Surf Coast but has been truncated by the most recent redistribution, areas south from Torquay now in neighbouring Polwarth. The 2022 election will see a return bout from the 2018 card with former Liberal MP Andrew Katos returning to contest against his successor, Labor's Darren Cheeseman. Katos represented South Barwon from 2010 to 2018, while Cheeseman previously held the local federal seat of Corangamite from 2007 to 2013.</p>
<p><a href="bena/index.html"><strong>Benambra (<span class="ptyblue">LIB 2.6% v IND</span>)</strong></a> is dominated by the City of Wodonga but also includes Rutherglen, Beechworth, Corryong, Tallangatta and Yackandandah. It has been a safe conservative seat for more than a century, held by the Liberal Party since 1976, and by current Liberal MP Bill Tilley since 2006. Benambra lies in the federal seat of Indi, represented by Independents since 2013, and Independent Jacqui Hawkins will be Tilley's major threat in 2022. Hawkins reduced the Liberal margin to 2.6% in 2018.</p>
<p><a href="polw/index.html"><strong>Polwarth (<span class="ptyblue">LIB 2.0%</span>)</strong></a> lies to the west and south-west of Geelong. Along the coast it follows the Great Ocean Road from Torquay through Aireys Inlet, Lorne and Apollo Bay and around Cape Otway to Port Campbell. Further inland, the electorate includes Winchelsea, Colac, Camperdown and Cobden. It is held by Liberal frontbencher Richard Riordan, opposed by former Victorian Labor Party President Hutch Hussein.</p>
<p><a href="soco/index.html"><strong>South-West Coast (<span class="ptyblue">LIB 3.2%</span>)</strong></a> takes in the coastal parts of the state's western districts with major centres including Portland and Warrnambool. It was held by former Premier Denis Napthine for many years, succeeded by current MP Roma Britnell in 2015. She will be opposed by former Warrnambool Mayor Kylie Gaston for Labor, and the seat has attracted several Independents including senior journalist Carol Altmann and former MLC James Purcell.</p>
<p><a href="mild/index.html"><strong>Mildura (<span class="ptyblack">IND 0.0% v NAT</span>)</strong></a> has a recent history of Independent challenges and has been held by Independent MP Ali Cupper since 2018. She won with a narrow 0.3% margin in 2018, a margin wiped out by areas around Donald being added in the redistribution. The contest begins anew in 2022 with Cupper opposed by National Jade Benham and Liberal Paul Matheson.</p>
<p><a href="morw/index.html"><strong>Morwell (*) (<span class="ptyred">ALP 4.0%</span>)</strong></a> is based on the coal mining and electricity generation towns of the LaTrobe valley. The seat runs along the Princes Highway from Moe through Morwell to Traralgon and was held by Labor from 1970 to 2006 when it was won by the National Party's Russell Northe. Northe left the National Party in 2017 and was narrowly re-elected as an Independent at the 2018 election. Northe is retiring at the 2022 election so Morwell becomes a notional Labor seat based on a 2018 two-party preferred results. Labor's position has also been boosted by the addition of Moe in the redistribution. The major party candidates are Labor's Kate Maxfield, National Martin Cameron and Liberal Dale Harriman.</p>
<p><a href="shep/index.html"><strong>Shepparton (<span class="ptyblack">IND 5.3% v LIB</span>)</strong></a> takes in most of the Greater Shepparton and Moira council areas. Independent MP Suzanna Sheed took this seat from the National Party in 2014, but has not built the sort of electoral buffer that rural Independents have developed across the Murray in NSW. Sheed will be opposed in 2022 by National candidate Kim O'Keeffe and Liberal Cheryl Hammer. The electorate has been badly hit by flooding in recent weeks.</p>

But after eight years in power and seeking a third term, governments are overwhelmingly judged on the good and the bad of their record in office.</p>\r\n<p>When the Andrews government was re-elected in 2018, no one knew that its second term would be dominated by a pandemic. Four years later, Covid's two-year thrall over Victoria is the lens through which many Victorians will view the government's record. </p>\r\n<p>The handling of Covid will haunt the 2022 election campaign. It is an issue that many government members would like to move on from, but many voters find hard to forget. Some voters will be keen for retribution against the government, others just want to move on and see the return to traditional politics.</p>\r\n<p>There are questions raised by the last four years. Did the Andrew's government mis-handle hotel isolation and contact tracing? Why did lockdowns and curfews need to be longer and tougher than in other states? Or did the Andrews government's actions save the state's economy from even  worse damage? </p>\r\n<p>The election won't answer those questions, but it will measure state-wide opinion on whether the Andrews government has performed well enough to be trusted with a third term. If re-elected, the government's return will have been assisted by opposition mis-steps.</p>\r\n<p>Former Liberal Leader Michael O'Brien struggled to both support Covid public health measures while attacking the government for mis-handling the state's Covid response. More aggressive attacks by Liberal frontbencher Tim Smith proved divisive, especially when confused with outside groups attacking mandatory vaccination rules. Matthew Guy returned for a second turn as Liberal leader in 2021.</p>\r\n<p>With questions over the government's record and an Opposition struggling to establish alternative government status, it leaves room for minor parties and independents to play an important role in the election result.</p>\r\n<h2>This Election Guide</h2>\r\n<p>The bulk of this guide consists of background pages on each of the state's 88 lower house districts. Each page covers the history, past results and a listing of candidates in ballot paper order. Candidate profiles with links and pictures will be added progressively for most candidates through the campaign.</p>\r\n<p>There are index pages to help navigate the site, with indexes by electorate name, electorate margin and candidate name, and summaries of key seats and retiring members. The indexes are linked from the top of each guide page, making the site easy to navigate without resorting to Google.</p>\r\n<p>There is also a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/lc-preview\&quot;">Preview for the Legislative Council</a> which includes links to background on the contest in each region, and a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/gvt-index\&quot;">Legislative Council voting guid</a>e which includes links to the registered group voting tickets (GVTs). There is also a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/calculator-upper\&quot;">Legislative Council Calculator</a> that applies GVTs to entered votes and predicts the winning candidates.</p>\r\n<p>On election night, and in the weeks that follow, the site will provide a full results service. The results service includes the unique feature of the Legislative Council Calculator to predict the upper house result.</p>\r\n<details open=\"open\">\r\n<summary>\r\n<h2>Covid and Recent Elections</h2>\r\n</summary>\r\n<p>At the height of Covid, voters rewarded incumbent governments with re-election in the ACT, Northern Territory, Queensland, Tasmania and most spectacularly in Western Australia.</p>\r\n<p>With the two worst years of Covid lockdowns now passed, the electoral mood in 2022 seems to have switched from rewarding governments to punishing them.</p>\r\n<p>In March 2022 the Marshall Liberal government in South Australia was defeated after its re-election campaign coincided with the state's first serious Covid outbreak. Then it was the turn of the Morrison government to be defeated at the Federal election in May.</p>\r\n<p>Will November's Victorian election be about reward or punishment? The period when fear was the emotion controlling public reaction to Covid restrictions has passed. Given how long and tough the Victorian lockdowns were, and how many people's livelihoods and lifestyles were damaged, resentment will be the reaction of some voters.</p>\r\n<p>Perceptions of how the Andrews government handled Covid will vary greatly depending on each voter's personal circumstances. Many voters were in a position where they could work from home. Others had their livelihoods ruined with small businesses closed and their employees out of work. People in insecure employment had little to fall back on.</p>\r\n<p>Census data suggests that those most impacted by Covid, in terms of both health and wealth, live overwhelmingly in Labor seats. Voters in middle class seats were more likely to be in occupations where working from home was easier. The clusters of trade workers in outer suburban seats found their  businesses locked out of travelling for work. Will this hurt Labor in outer suburban seats not normally viewed as competitive?</p>\r\n<p>The last term of government has created a more polarised electorate, but disenchantment with the Andrews government may not translate into Coalition gains. Recent Victorian political history and geography suggest it will be difficult for the Coalition to win the 2022 election. There was little encouragement for the Victorian Liberal Party in May's Federal election result.</p>\r\n<p>Both parties have had internal problems since 2018. Labor was shaken by rampant branch stacking, which combined with ministerial exhaustion post-Covid, sees the government lose a large slice of frontbench talent at the 2022 election. The Liberal Party has seen the departure and return of Matthew Guy as Leader. There have also been disputes over pre-selection and the party's own version of branch stacking. Liberal frontbencher Tim Smith attracted controversy with his attacks on the Andrews government over its handling of Covid. He attracted even more controversy as Shadow Attorney General when he crashed his car and was convicted of drink driving. Smith is not contesting the 2022 election.</p>\r\n<p>But saying that the Coalition will struggle to win does not mean the Andrews government is headed for an easy victory. There are enough seats where the government will suffer significant swings against it to suggest the government cannot stroll back into office, whatever the polls say.</p>\r\n<p>The uneven impact of Covid could produce an equally uneven pattern of swings. Labor saw a significant rise in Independent vote in some of its safest Melbourne seats in 2018. Inflation and rising interest rates may cause Melbourne's mortgage belt to be more important than it has been at recent elections.</p>\r\n<p>The Coalition can take seats from Labor. Labor could also lose safe seats to Greens and independents. Taken together these probably won't be enough to defeat the Andrews government, but it leaves minority Labor government as a possible outcome.</p>\r\n</details>\r\n<details open=\"open\">\r\n<summary>\r\n<h2>Going for a Third Term</h2>\r\n</summary>\r\n<p>In seeking a third term on 26 November, Daniel Andrews will be hoping to emulate two of his Labor predecessors, John Cain Junior and Steve Bracks, who both won three elections. If he loses after two terms, there will be a less flattering comparison with former Liberal Premier Jeff Kennett.</p>\r\n<p>Labor has won eight of the last 11 Victorian elections and governed the state for 29 of the last 40 years. It is a far cry from the state's history before 1982 when Labor governments were rare and brief. Over four decades, Victoria has gone from the 'jewel in the Liberal crown' to being the 'Massachusetts of Australia politics'.</p>\r\n<p>The Victorian Liberal Party suffered a heavy defeat in 2018, and had an equally bad result at May's Federal election. The Liberal Party lost the federal seats of Higgins and Chisholm to Labor and the heartland seats of Kooyong and Goldstein to 'teal' independents.</p>\r\n<p>The 'teals' will again be an issue for the Liberal Party at the state election, but Labor faces its own problems with Independents in its safe seats.</p>\r\n<p>A redistribution since the last election has continued the trend of recent decades where seats in Liberal voting eastern Melbourne have been abolished and replaced by new seats in Labor voting areas west of the Yarra. It is a trend eating away at Melbourne's stock of safe Liberal seats. (<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/redistribution\&quot;">You can read a summary of the redistribution here</a>)</p>\r\n<p>Elsewhere, Labor has had a lock on regional seats in western Victoria since the defeat of the Kennett government in 1999, and the Liberal Party hasn't won a Metropolitan seat north or west of the Yarra this century. If Labor can keep its lock on both areas, and win enough seats down the spine of south-east Melbourne, then Labor can retain office even if the Coalition recovers the eastern Melbourne seats lost in 2018.</p>\r\n<p>The threat to Labor west of the Yarra could come from Independents. After eight years in office and delays in road, rail and health infrastructure, Independents championing the west have emerged in seats like Melton, Werribee and Point Cook. There are also huge candidate numbers with 14 in Melton and 15 in Point Cook and Werribee. Results could be influenced by a rise in informal voting and the vagaries of ballot paper order.</p>\r\n<p> Labor also faces a threat in inner Melbourne where the Greens hope to double their representation. These hopes have been boosted by the Liberal Party's decision to put Labor behind the Greens on all how-to-votes and to campaign with a &quot;Put Labor Last&quot; slogan.</p>\r\n<p>The  Coalition winning government in its own right appears unlikely given the swing needed, but the prospect of the Andrews government losing its majority remains a live option.</p>\r\n</details>\r\n<details open=\"open\">\r\n<summary>\r\n<h2>The Swings Needed</h2>\r\n</summary>\r\n<p>Labor won 55 of the 88 seats in Legislative Assembly at the 2018 election, double the Coalition's 27 seats (21 Liberals, six Nationals). Three Greens and three Independents were also elected.</p>\r\n<p>The starting point for the 2022 election has been changed by retirements and a redistribution. While there are different interpretations of the new numbers, the ABC's starting point is Labor on 56 seats, the Coalition 27 (21 Liberals, 6 Nationals), three Greens and two Independents. (<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/redistribution\&quot;">You can read more about the redistribution here.</a>) </p>\r\n<p>Majority government requires 45 seats, giving government 44 of 87 seats on the Assembly floor and the ability to determine who fills the powerful Speaker's position.</p>\r\n<p>The Coalition took office after the 2010 election with a tenuous majority holding 45 seats to Labor's 43 seats and no crossbench. The later resignation of backbencher Geoff Shaw from the Liberal Party left the Napthine government with only 43 secure votes on the Assembly floor. The government found itself unable to control the business of the Assembly in a way that would once have brought on an early election. The loss of Shaw's vote paralysed the government, but Labor would not use his vote to bring down the government and invoke the procedures to change government or bring on an early election.</p>\r\n<p>The problems of the Napthine government revealed a weakness in the state's fixed term parliament rules. The rules were designed to prevent strong governments calling early elections. It hadn't been anticipated that a weak government could be trapped in office if no alternative government were available and the Opposition declined to bring the government down.</p>\r\n<p>The two elections since have produced clearer outcomes with Labor winning in 2014 with 47 seats, and re-elected with 55 in 2018. There were also three crossbenchers elected in 2014 and six in 2018. It is likely that crossbench numbers will increase at the 2022 election.</p>\r\n<p>If neither side of politics wins 45 seats, the crossbench will have a role in determining who forms government. Traditionally the side of politics with more seats has the better chance of forming government in a hung parliament. But not always.</p>\r\n<p>In 1999 the Bracks government took office with 42 seats against 43 for the soon to split Coalition, the three crossbench independents choosing to back Labor. The Bracks government later reached majority via by-elections, though maintained a close association with the crossbench.</p>\r\n<p>Given the presence of the Greens in the Assembly, it is unlikely that the Coalition could form minority government if Labor plus the Greens had a combined majority. The maths of who forms government would become more complex if both the Greens and Independents were required for Labor to govern, or there were enough Independents to allow the Coalition to govern.</p>\r\n<p>The decline in the number of two-party preferred contests and the presence of the crossbench complicates trying to define the swings needed for government. Assuming two-party preferred swings, here are some scenarios for the swing needed -</p>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n<li><strong>7.1% for Labor to retain majority</strong>  - Labor could lose 11 seats to the Coalition and still retain majority government, assuming no gains by the crossbench.</li>\r\n<li><strong>10.5% for a Coalition majority</strong>  - the Coalition need to gain 18 seats from Labor for majority government, assuming no changes on the crossbench.</li>\r\n<li><strong>10.2% for the Coalition to have more seats than Labor</strong>  - if the Coalition gain 15 seats from Labor, they would finish with more seats, again assuming no change on the crossbench.</li>\r\n<li><strong>10.2% for a Labor plus Greens Majority</strong>  - Labor and the Greens hold a combined 59 seats. Even if the Greens take seats from Labor, it will take a combined loss of 14 seats for the two parties to lose their majority.</li>\r\n<li><strong>For no Overall Majority</strong> - If Labor loses seats to the Greens or Independents, then the swing for Labor to lose its overall majority is less than 7.1%. Losses to independents would also reduce the swing needed to deprive Labor and the Greens of a joint majority. Every seat the Coalition loses to an Independent or Green increases the swing meeded for the Coalition to achieve majority government or finish with more seats than Labor.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Given past antipathy between Labor and the Greens, Labor may prefer to govern in minority rather than arrange a formal governing arrangement with the Greens. As has happened previously in the Legislative Council, Labor would find it easier to govern in minority if there were enough Independents to create an alternative pathway to control the chamber and pass legislation.</p>\r\n</details>\r\n<details open=\"open\">\r\n<summary>\r\n<h2>The 2018 Election</h2>\r\n</summary>\r\n<p>A vigorous campaign by the Opposition on law and order, combined with opinion polls indicating a  close result, suggested it would take a while to to determine the winner on election night in 2018.</p>\r\n<p>Instead the result was clear within an hour. By 7:15pm the ABC was able to call the re-election of the Andrews government with a substantial increase in its majority. The rest of the evening was given over to assessing the scale of damage for the Coalition.</p>\r\n<p>Among the Liberal losses was senior frontbencher John Pesutto, who had the misfortune of being on the ABC's election night panel as it became apparent he would lose his seat of Hawthorn. It took a week of counting to confirm his defeat, but the swing in Hawthorn was repeated in a string of traditional Liberal seats in Melbourne's east and inner south-east. The presumed tight contest turned into a rout.</p>\r\n<div class=\"responsive-table\">\r\n  <table class=\"eg-table\" id=\"results_summary\">\r\n  <caption>\r\n\t  <h2>2018 Legislative Assembly Election</h2>\r\n  </caption>\r\n  <thead>\r\n    <tr class=\"solid\">\r\n      <th class=\"left\"><br />\r\n        Party (Candidates)</th>\r\n      <th class=\"right\"><br />\r\n        Votes</th>\r\n      <th class=\"right\"><br />\r\n        % Votes</th>\r\n      <th class=\"right\"><br />\r\n        Swing</th>\r\n      <th class=\"centre\">Seats<br />\r\n        Won</th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </thead>\r\n  <tbody>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td class=\"left ptyred\">Labor Party (88)</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">1,506,460</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">42.86</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">+4.77</td>\r\n      <td class=\"centre\">55</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td class=\"left ptyblue\">Liberal Party (80)</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">1,069,287</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">30.43</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">-6.04</td>\r\n      <td class=\"centre\">21</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td class=\"left ptygreen\">The Nationals (10)</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">167,625</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">4.77</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">-0.76</td>\r\n      <td class=\"centre\">6</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td class=\"left ptylightgreen\">Greens (88)</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">376,470</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">10.71</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">-0.77</td>\r\n      <td class=\"centre\">3</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td class=\"left ptyblack\">Independents (98)</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">211,700</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">6.02</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">+2.72</td>\r\n      <td class=\"centre\">3</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td class=\"left ptyblack\">Animal Justice (43)</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">63,970</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">1.82</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">+1.59</td>\r\n      <td class=\"centre\">..</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td class=\"left ptyblack\">Others (100)</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">118,962</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">3.39</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">-1.51</td>\r\n      <td class=\"centre\">..</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td class=\"left\">Formal (507)</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">3,514,474</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">94.17</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\"></td>\r\n      <td class=\"centre\"></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td class=\"left\">Informal</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">217,592</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">5.83</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">+0.61</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\"></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td class=\"left\">Total Votes / Turnout</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">3,732,066</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">90.16</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">-2.86</td>\r\n      <td class=\"centre\"></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td class=\"left\">Enrolment</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">4,139,326</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n      <td class=\"centre\"></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr class=\"solid\">\r\n      <td class=\"left\" colspan=\"5\"><strong>Two-Party Preferred Vote</strong></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr class=\"even\">\r\n      <td class=\"left ptyred\">Labor</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">2,025,669</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">57.6</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">+5.6</td>\r\n      <td class=\"centre\"></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\r\n      <td class=\"left ptyblue\">Coalition</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">1,490,103</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">42.4</td>\r\n      <td class=\"right\">-5.6</td>\r\n      <td class=\"centre\"></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The two-party preferred swing to Labor was 6.2% in metropolitan Melbourne, 5.5% in regional cities and 3.1% in country Victoria.

When John Cain Junior led Labor to victory at the 1982 state election, it was only the second time the state had elected a majority Labor government. When Cain won a second victory in 1985, his was the first Victorian Labor government to win re-election.</p>\r\n<p>Victoria has had four changes of government since the 1982 election. The first was Labor's emphatic ejection from office in 1992, a second the upset defeat to the Kennett government in 1999. After 11 years of the Bracks and Brumby Labor governments, the third and fourth changes in 2010 and 2014 bookended a one-term interlude for the Coalition under Ted Baillieu and Denis Napthine.</p>\r\n<p>Each of these changes of government reveal key features of the electoral geography of Victoria, and in particular Melbourne. They provide pointers to where the 2022 Victorian election will be decided.</p>\r\n<p>Outside of Melbourne, electorates can be split into predominantly rural seats, and a cluster of more urban regional seats based on Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong, along with the Latrobe Valley seats of Narracan and Morwell.</p>\r\n<p>Inside Melbourne, Labor dominates the areas north and west of the Yarra. The Liberal Party’s homeland has always been the swathe of middle-class seats sweeping up into the Dandenongs between the Yarra River and the Monash Freeway. There is an adjoining patch of inner south-east Liberal of seats wedged between the Monash and Port Phillip Bay.</p>\r\n<p>Beyond the inner south-east runs a varied collection of seats extending to Point Nepean and Pakenham. The Liberal Party generally do better along the bay, Labor in the 'sandbelt' wedge running to industrial areas around Dandenong, and there is an ever expanding fringe of seats based on new housing on the south-east edge of the metropolitan area.</p>\r\n<p>For four decades, the growth pattern of Melbourne has seen Liberal voting eastern Melbourne lose seats while Labor voting Melbourne north and west of the Yarra has gained seats. There has also been a slow shift of seats from inner to outer Melbourne, especially in the  city's south-east.</p>\r\n<p>As Melbourne has sprawled ever outward, providing services to the new housing estates on the expanding south-east fringe of Melbourne has tended to dominate state politics. That has certainly been the case at the last three state elections.</p>\r\n<p>Looking back to the 1980s, Labor's push into the Liberal Party's eastern Melbourne heartland put the Cain government into office in 1982. Labor's narrow re-elections in 1985 and 1988 were built on holding enough seats in Melbourne's east to achieve a majority. That ended when Labor lost every seat in the east on the defeat of the Kirner government in 1992.</p>\r\n<p>Labor's victory over Jeff Kennett in 1999  has left an imprint on every election since. It may seem ancient history in 2022, but Labor’s victory had two important consequences. One was on perceptions of Labor's ability to govern, the second on how Labor wins Victorian elections.</p>\r\n<p>First, after two terms of tough economic reform, the Kennett government’s loss handed the keys of office to Labor just as the early 2000s economic boom began. There have been some questions since over the Kennett government's legacy in the public sector, but few have questioned his government’s record in cutting debt and making the state's economy more competitive. But defeat in 1999 deprived the Coalition of governing in the good times that its hard years had helped create. The good times fell into Labor's lap.</p>\r\n<p>The second impact of the 1999 election was to entrench Labor in a string of regional seats. Twenty-three years after the 1999 election, Labor continues to hold the four Ballarat and Bendigo seats along with Geelong and Macedon. Labor has held Bellarine continuously since 2002 and also has a good record of winning South Barwon and Ripon. Labor rarely held more than two or three non-metropolitan seats before 1999.</p>\r\n<p>The 1999 election was also the last time the Liberal Party won a Melbourne seat north or west of the Yarra. The Liberal Party won four seats in the region in 1992, lost Essendon and Ivanhoe in 1996, Tullamarine in 1999, and Eltham in 2002. The Liberal Party has not won a metropolitan seat north or west of the Yarra this century.</p>\r\n<p>Holding so many regional seats means that Labor no longer needs to win seats in eastern Melbourne  to achieve government. Labor won only a single seat in eastern Melbourne in 1999, only a single eastern seat when the Brumby government lost office in 2010, and again only one on the election of the Andrews government in 2014.</p>\r\n<p>Labor won seven eastern Melbourne seats in 2018, reduced to five by the redistribution. In 2022 the Liberal Party needs to recover these seats, as well as defend a string of its own seats on tiny margins in eastern Melbourne, and also in the wedge of seats between the Monash and Port Phillip Bay.</p>\r\n<p>So many seats at play makes these Liberal areas look like a key battleground. They aren't. Even if the Liberal Party recovers its crown jewels in the east and along the bay, Labor would still hold more seats than the Coalition.</p>\r\n<p>It is better to look at the closely fought 2010 and 2014 elections to see where Victorian elections are decided. The Frankston Line seats of Bentleigh, Mordialloc, Carrum and Frankston put the Baillieu government into office in 2010 and defeated the Napthine government in 2014. The problem for the Coalition in 2022 is that these seats saw some of the biggest swings to Labor in 2018. The Liberal Party need to generate equally large swings in its favour to be in contention for government in 2022. The same comment applies to nearby areas of the south-east, now in the seats of Cranbourne, Hastings, Berwick, Pakenham and Bass. </p>\r\n<p>There are areas north and west of the Yarra that are growing as quickly as the south-east and where Labor may suffer in 2022. A new crossing of the Yarra to improve road access has yet to be completed. Improving western rail services means untangling access to Southern Cross station and expanding the existing rail network. These tasks are more complex and more expensive than the improvements achieved in south-east Melbourne by removing level crossings.</p>\r\n<p>The question is, who benefits if Labor loses support in its western heartland? The Liberal Party has a poor electoral record in the west. Can it do better or will Independents be a greater threat to Labor? Can the Coalition win the election, or is the Andrews government losing its majority the best outcome the Coalition can achieve?</p>\r\n</details>\r\n<h2>Where the Election will be Decided</h2>\r\n<details open=\"open\">\r\n<summary>\r\n<h2>The Fate of the Liberal Party's Jewels</h2>\r\n</summary>\r\n<p>As bad as the 2018 election was for the Liberal Party, it could have been worse. Thirteen of the party's 21 seats were left dangling at the bottom of the electoral pendulum on margins under 3%. Going into the 2022 election, the Liberal Party's safest metropolitan  seat is Malvern on just 6.0%.</p>\r\n<p>Before the Coalition can challenge Labor for government, the Liberal Party must first recover and secure its 'crown jewels', the band of traditional Liberal seats that run from Beaumaris north to Kew and then into the eastern suburbs.</p>\r\n<p>Four of the seats of greatest interest lie in the Federal seats of Goldstein and Kooyong, gained by 'teal' independents at May's Federal election. In Kooyong, Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg was defeated by Independent Dr Monique Ryan, while Goldstein saw Zoe Daniel defeat Tim Wilson.</p>\r\n<p><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/kew/\&quot;"><strong>Kew (<span class=\"ptyblue\">LIB 4.7%</span>)</strong></a> covers the northern part of Kooyong and has long been one of Melbourne's 'establishment' seats represented by Premiers and senior frontbenchers. The Liberal Party faces two problems. First, departing Liberal MP Tim Smith was controversial for his attacks on the Andrews government's handling of Covid, and for his personal humiliation over a car accident and drink driving conviction. Second, 'teal' success in Kooyong has spawned a strong Independent in Sophie Torney, a businesswoman and daughter of eminent Liberal Party historian Ian Hancock. New Liberal candidate Jess Wilson previously worked for the Business Council and for Josh Frydenberg. The Liberal Party need Wilson to win.</p>\r\n<p>The southern half of Kooyong covers another traditional Liberal seat in <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/hawt/\&quot;"><strong>Hawthorn (<span class=\"ptyred\">ALP 0.6%</span>)</strong></a>. It provided a dramatic upset in 2018 when little known Labor candidate John Kennedy defeated senior Liberal frontbencher John Pesutto. The drama was heightened by Pesutto being on the ABC's election night panel as the story of his defeat unfolded. Pesutto is re-contesting and has a considerably higher profile courtesy of his very public defeat. Unknown in 2018 and living in a retirement village, few give Kennedy much chance of a repeat win in 2022. The seat has also attracted a high-profile 'teal' independent in Melissa Lowe.</p>\t\r\n<p>Within Goldstein are the bayside Liberal seats of <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/brig/\&quot;"><strong>Brighton (<span class=\"ptyblue\">LIB 0.5%</span>)</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/sand/\&quot;"><strong>Sandringham (<span class=\"ptyblue\">LIB 0.4%</span>)</strong></a>. Brighton was first contested in 1856 and has never left the Liberal fold. Sandringham was first contested in 1955 and only once been won by Labor. Both seats had retiring members in 2018 and came close to being lost to 'no-name' Labor candidates. The first term Liberal MPs are James Newbury in Brighton and Brad Rowswell in Sandringham. Labor's candidates are Louise Crawford in Brighton and Bettina Prescott in Sandringham. Newbury withstood a pre-selection challenge from former Bayside Council Mayor Felicity Frederico. She has chosen to renew the battle by nominating as an Independent.</p>\r\n<p> To begin a list of must win seats with the Liberal bastions of Brighton, Hawthorn, Kew and Sandringham shows the scale of the 2018 defeat. It gets worse when the fifth seat listed is <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/caul/\&quot;"><strong>Caulfield (<span class=\"ptyblue\">LIB 0.04%</span>)</strong></a>. Caufield has never been won by Labor since it was first contested in 1927 and is currently held by Liberal Deputy Leader David Southwick. Post-redistribution it is not entirely clear that Caufield still has a Liberal majority. He faces a challenge in 2022 from two with strong opponents in Labor's Lior Harel and Independent Nomi Kaltmann. All three candidates are of Jewish faith, Caulfield having by far the state's highest proportion of Jewish residents.</p>\r\n<p>Further east, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/bays/\&quot;"><strong>Bayswater (*) (<span class=\"ptyblue\">LIB 0.6%</span>)</strong></a> has undergone significant boundary changes. It was won by Labor in 2018, but has been merged with the abolished neighbouring Liberal seat of Ferntree Gully. The new Bayswater has roughly equal numbers from both former seats and will be contested by two sitting members, Bayswater's Labor MP Jackson Taylor, and Liberal MP Nick Wakeling, who has represented Ferntree Gully since 2006.

Few are predicting the Liberal Party will recover them, but Carrum and Frankston in particular may see substantial swings.</p>\r\n<p>Another rail seat but on a different line is <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/cran/\&quot;"><strong>Cranbourne (<span class=\"ptyred\">ALP 9.3%</span>)</strong></a>, which also recorded a big swing to Labor in 2018. It differs in being a rapidly growing seat with acres of new housing where services are struggling to keep up with population growth. It also has one of Melbourne's highest concentrations of small business owners and managers, a group badly hit by pandemic lockdowns. Labor's Pauline Richards was first elected in 2018 and her Liberal opponent is Jagdeep Singh.</p>\r\n<p><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/nano/\&quot;"><strong>Narre Warren North (<span class=\"ptyred\">ALP 10.4%</span>)</strong></a> is on a swing that if reached puts the Coalition close to majority government. Labor is disadvantaged by the retirement of two-decade veteran Luke Donnellan, forced to resign from the ministry over branch stacking. The seat covers Endeavour Hills, Hallam and Narre Warren and the new Labor candidate is Belinda Wilson, her Liberal opponent Timothy Dragan. Narre Warren North is one of Melbourne's fringe seats that were badly affected by movement restrictions during the Covid lockdowns.</p>\r\n<p>Huge over-enrolment in the former seats of Gembrook and Bass has seen major boundary changes with Gembrook abolished and two new seats created, Berwick and Pakenham. The cascade of consequent boundary changes has flipped Bass from Labor to Liberal while Hastings has had its Liberal majority wiped out.</p>\r\n<p><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/berw/\&quot;"><strong>Berwick (<span class=\"ptyblue\">LIB 1.3%</span>)</strong></a> last existed the 1990s but was abolished in 2002. Population growth in Melbourne's outer south-east has seen it re-created for the 2022 election, taking in around 21,000 voters from the western end of Gembrook, 16,000 from Narre Warren South, and 10,500 voters in Clyde North from Bass. Berwick will be contested by Gembrook Liberal MP and Shadow Police Minister Brad Battin. His Labor opponent Mailk Zaveer will struggle to win.</p>\r\n<p><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/pake/\&quot;"><strong>Pakenham (<span class=\"ptyred\">ALP 2.2%</span>)</strong></a> is another former seat re-created for the 2022 election. It covers the advancing front of new housing estates on Melbourne's south-east edge. It takes in  Officer and Pakenham, previously divided between Bass and Gembrook. Based on 2018 results Pakenham has a notional Labor majority but will not be defended by a sitting Labor MP. The competing candidates are Labor's Emma Vulin and Liberal David Farrelly. This is a must win seat for the Liberal Party.</p>\r\n<p><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/bass/\&quot;"><strong>Bass (*) (<span class=\"ptyblue\">LIB 0.7%</span>)</strong></a> is the first predominantly rural electorate south-east of Melbourne though its north-western corner includes parts of rapidly growing Clyde. It runs around the northern and eastern shores of Western Port Bay and extends to Phillip Island, Wonthaggi and Inverloch. Bass was won by Labor's Jordan Crugnale in 2018, but the carving out of Pakenham from the seat's northern edge has transformed Bass into a notional Liberal seat. Crugnale's Liberal opponent is Aaron Brown, whose father Alan Brown represented areas covered by Bass between 1979 to 1996. The National candidate is Brett Tessari. Bass is a must win/retain seat for the Liberal Party.</p>\r\n<p>On the western shore of Western Port Bay lies <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/hast/\&quot;"><strong>Hastings (<span class=\"ptyblue\">LIB 0.0%</span>)</strong></a> It runs from Langwarrin in the north, through Somerville, Tyabb and Hastings to Crib Point, Balnarring and Somers in the south. The redistribution has virtually wiped out the Liberal majority, and the Liberal Party is further disadvantaged by the retirement of sitting MP Neale Burgess. The new Liberal candidate is Briony Hutton, her Labor opponent former dancer and actor Paul Mercurio. Three decades ago, Mercurio played the lead character Scott Hastings in the hit Australian movie 'Strictly Ballroom', though his real name appearing on ballot papers rules out a 'Hasting for Hastings' campaign. Another must win seat for the Liberal Party.</p>\r\n<p><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/nepe/\&quot;"><strong>Nepean (<span class=\"ptyred\">ALP 0.7%</span>)</strong></a> covers the western tip of the Mornington Peninsula and runs along the southern shore of Port Phillip Bay from Safety Beach through Dromana, Rosebud, Rye, Sorrento and Portsea to Point Nepean. If Kew and Hawthorn are Liberal establishment seats, then Nepean is where the establishment have their beach houses. Nepean delivered an upset in 2018 when Labor's Chris Brayne, a candidate few Labor spokespeople could name, emerged victorious. The Liberal Party has chosen a high-profile candidate to try and recover Nepean in journalist and former professional tennis player Sam Groth.</p>\r\n<p>Finally there is <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/morn/\&quot;"><strong>Mornington (<span class=\"ptyblue\">LIB 5.0%</span>)</strong></a>, which covers the peninsula suburbs of Mount Eliza, Mornington, Mount Martha and Moorooduc. Liberal MP David Morris is retiring after being defeated for pre-election by former Federal MP for Frankston-based Dunkley, Chris Crewther. In a seat where the Liberal Party is under little threat from Labor, a new challenger has emerged in Climate 200 endorsed 'teal' Independent Dr Kate Lardner.</p>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details open=\"open\">\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\n<h2>Inner-City Green Contests</h2>\r\n</summary>\r\n<p>The inner-city seats  surrounding the Melbourne CBD have been transformed demographically over the last two decades. The decline in Australia's manufacturing industries, and the departure of the remaining manufacturers to greenfield sites elsewhere has changed the population of inner-Melbourne. Formerly working-class neighbourhoods have been gentrified, apart from the remaining public housing blocks. The areas now have populations with well above average levels of university education and professional employment.</p>\r\n<p>Once working class Labor bastions  are now marginal seats, though the district's new arrivals do not vote Liberal. Instead this band of inner-city seats have become contests on the left between Labor and the Greens. And election after election, the Greens have been making gains.</p>\r\n<p>The Greens currently hold three  seats, and the party's chances of making gains have been boosted by the Liberal Party's decision to preference the Greens ahead of Labor. It increases the chances of the Greens  winning the balance of power in the Legislative Assembly.</p>\r\n<p>The Greens will hold <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/melb/\&quot;"><strong>Melbourne (<span class=\"ptylightgreen\">GRN 1.6% v ALP</span>)</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/brun/\&quot;"><strong>Brunswick (<span class=\"ptylightgreen\">GRN 2.0% v ALP</span>)</strong></a>. The party's third seat, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/prah/\&quot;"><strong>Prahran (<span class=\"ptylightgreen\">GRN 9.0% v LIB</span>)</strong></a>, looks safer with the Liberal decision on preferences. Prahran is more socially mixed and has a higher Liberal vote than other seats in the region. It is the state's smallest electorate at just 10.9 square kilometres and has been won by the  Greens' Sam Hibbins from third place at the last two elections. Both times he eked out victory by first passing Labor on lower placed candidate preferences to reach second place, then passing the Liberal candidate on Labor preferences. The only threat to Hibbins in 2022 would have been the Liberals slipping to third place,but the change in Liberal preferences means Hibbins should win easily.</p>\r\n<p><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/nort/\&quot;"><strong>Northcote (<span class=\"ptyred\">ALP 1.7% v GRN</span>)</strong></a> includes the inner northern suburbs of Northcote, Fairfield, Alphington, Thornbury and parts of Preston. Labor lost Northcote to the Greens at a 2017 by-election following the death of popular MP Fiona Richardson, but the seat was recovered for Labor by Kat Theophanous at the 2018 state election. The Green candidate at the 2022 election is Campbell Gome and his prospects of victory are strong.</p>\r\n<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/rich/\&quot;"><strong>Richmond (<span class=\"ptyred\">ALP 5.8% v GRN</span>)</strong></a> is the state's second smallest electorate at just 12.5 square kilometres and takes in Clifton Hill, Fitzroy, Collingwood, Abbotsford, Richmond, Cremorne and Burnley. Labor has scrambled to victory over the Greens in Richmond for the last two decades, but will be disadvantaged in 2022 by the retirement of long serving MP Richard Wynne. The new Labor candidate is Lauren O'Dwyer, while the Greens' candidate is Yarra City Councillor Gabrielle de Vietri. The Liberal Party did not contest Richmond in 2018 and the party's candidate in 2022 is Lucas Moon. This will be a tough seat for Labor to hold.\r\n<p>On paper <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/albe/\&quot;"><strong>Albert Park (<span class=\"ptyred\">ALP 13.1%</span>)</strong></a> is a safe Labor seat, but the contest has been opened up by the retirement of veteran MP and former Health Minister Martin Foley. The new Labor candidate is Southern Metropolitan MLC Nina Taylor, opposed by Liberal Lauren Sherson and Greens candidate Kim Samiotis. The Greens usually finish third in Albert Park but outpolled the Liberals in the seat based on May's Federal results. If repeated at the state election, then there is a chance that Liberal preferences could elect the Greens if the party can close the first preference gap on Labor.</p>\r\n<p>In two other seats, a higher proportion of working class migrant voters keeps Labor's first preference vote at a level that won't see the second placed Greens win <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/pres/\&quot;"><strong>Preston (<span class=\"ptyred\">ALP 21.2% v GRN</span>)</strong></a> or <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/foot/\&quot;"><strong>Footscray (<span class=\"ptyred\">ALP 28.7%</span>)</strong></a>. <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/pasc/\&quot;"><strong>Pascoe Vale (<span class=\"ptyred\">ALP 22.3%</span>)</strong></a> could also switch to a Labor-Green contest for the first time.</p>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details open=\"open\">\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\n<h2>Western Suburbs</h2>\r\n</summary>\r\n<p>After the redistribution there are 28 metropolitan seats north and west of the Yarra. Two are currently held by the Greens and 26 by Labor, including 17 on margins greater than 15%. There is only one Labor seat in the region on a margin under 5%, and the Liberal Party has not won a seat north or west of the Yarra since the turn of the century.</p>\r\n<p>While the Liberal Party looks unlikely to make a breakthrough in the region, there are several seats where Labor is under threat from Independents.</p>\r\n<p>The first is <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/melt/\&quot;"><strong>Melton (<span class=\"ptyred\">ALP 5.0%</span>)</strong></a>, a rapidly growing metropolitan area of its own separated from the rest of western Melbourne's sprawling housing estates. Melton is the only seat in Melbourne to have swung against Labor at the last two elections. Improvment in local services has fallen short of public expectations, population growth and election promises. Labor MP Steve McGhie's first election in 2018 was helped by 12 candidates being on the ballot paper, splitting the anti-Labor vote. This time there are 14 candidates, but Independent Dr Ian Birchall has a higher profile than when he contested in 2018. On the new boundaries Birchall would would have come close to victory in 2018 and is a major threat to Labor in 2022. The Liberal candidate is an experienced campaigner in former Burwood MP Graham Watt, who now lives in Melton.</p>\r\n<p><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/poin/\&quot;"><strong>Point Cook (<span class=\"ptyred\">ALP 12.8%</span>)</strong></a> is the new name for Altona where former Attorney-General Jill Hennessy is retiring. This is also a  rapidly growing district, this time in the Wyndham council area in south west Melbourne. The new Labor candidate is Mat Hilakari who is relatively new to the district. The Liberal candidate is Angela Newhouse, but the greater threat to Labor may be Independent Dr Joe Garra. He polled strongly in neighbouring Werribee in 2018, but new boundaries mean he now lives in Point Cook. Garra has a higher profile in 2022 due to regular media appearances during Covid. Garra has drawn badly in being placed last in a field of 15 candidates.</p>\r\n<p>Neighbouring <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/werr/\&quot;"><strong>Werribee (<span class=\"ptyred\">ALP 9.2% v IND</span>)</strong></a> is also based in Wyndham Council. The area has been represented by Treasurer Tim Pallas since 2006, but his margin was cut by Independent challenger Dr Joe Garra in 2018. Garra is contesting Point Cook  in 2022, but Pallas still faces a serious challenge. Liberal candidate Mia Shaw is in her second term on Wyndham City Council and has previously served as Mayor. She might have run as an Independent had she not been recruited by the Liberal Party. The Independent that has emerged is Paul Hopper. He runs a chain of successful car dealerships across Melbourne's west and south-west. Pallas has been helped by drawing top spot on a ballot paper of 15 candidates.</p>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details open=\"open\">\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\n<h2>Away from Melbourne</h2>\r\n</summary>\r\n<p>The result of the election will be decided in metropolitan Melbourne, but there are a number of rural and regional seats worth watching.</p>\r\n<p><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/ripo/\&quot;"><strong>Ripon (*) (<span class=\"ptyred\">ALP 2.7%</span>)</strong></a> lies to the west of Ballarat and Bendigo. Its major centres are Creswick, Ararat, Maryborough, Avoca, Wedderburn, Skipton, Bridgewater and St Arnaud. Ripon was one of Labor surprise gains in 1999 and was held for Labor by Joe Helper until his retirement in 2014 when current Liberal MP Louise Staley was elected. She survived the 2018 election by only 15 votes after a re-count and has since had her margin wiped out by the redistribution. While she needs a 2.7% swing to her for re-election, Staley is favoured to win against her  Labor opponent Martha Haylett.</p>\r\n<p><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/sobo/\&quot;"><strong>South Barwon (<span class=\"ptyred\">ALP 3.0</span>)</strong></a> covers the southern parts of the Greater Geelong council area, generally south of the Barwon River. It previously extended furthern south into the Surf Coast but has been truncated by the most recent redistribution, areas south from Torquay now in neighbouring Polwarth. The 2022 election will see a return bout from the 2018 card with former Liberal MP Andrew Katos returning to contest against his successor, Labor's Darren Cheeseman. Katos represented South Barwon from 2010 to 2018, while Cheeseman previously held the local federal seat of Corangamite from 2007 to 2013.</p>\r\n<p><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/bena/\&quot;"><strong>Benambra (<span class=\"ptyblue\">LIB 2.6% v IND</span>)</strong></a> is dominated by the City of Wodonga but also includes Rutherglen, Beechworth, Corryong, Tallangatta and Yackandandah. It has been a safe conservative seat for more than a century, held by the Liberal Party since 1976, and by current Liberal MP Bill Tilley since 2006. Benambra lies in the federal seat of Indi, represented by Independents since 2013, and Independent Jacqui Hawkins will be Tilley's major threat in 2022. Hawkins reduced the Liberal margin to 2.6% in 2018.</p>\r\n<p><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/polw/\&quot;"><strong>Polwarth (<span class=\"ptyblue\">LIB 2.0%</span>)</strong></a> lies to the west and south-west of Geelong. Along the coast it follows the Great Ocean Road from Torquay through Aireys Inlet, Lorne and Apollo Bay and around Cape Otway to Port Campbell. Further inland, the electorate includes Winchelsea, Colac, Camperdown and Cobden. It is held by Liberal frontbencher Richard Riordan, opposed by former Victorian Labor Party President Hutch Hussein.</p>\r\n<p><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/soco/\&quot;"><strong>South-West Coast (<span class=\"ptyblue\">LIB 3.2%</span>)</strong></a> takes in the coastal parts of the state's western districts with major centres including Portland and Warrnambool. It was held by former Premier Denis Napthine for many years, succeeded by current MP Roma Britnell in 2015. She will be opposed by former Warrnambool Mayor Kylie Gaston for Labor, and the seat has attracted several Independents including senior journalist Carol Altmann and former MLC James Purcell.</p>\r\n<p><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/mild/\&quot;"><strong>Mildura (<span class=\"ptyblack\">IND 0.0% v NAT</span>)</strong></a> has a recent history of Independent challenges and has been held by Independent MP Ali Cupper since 2018. She won with a narrow 0.3% margin in 2018, a margin wiped out by areas around Donald being added in the redistribution. The contest begins anew in 2022 with Cupper opposed by National Jade Benham and Liberal Paul Matheson.</p>\r\n<p><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/morw/\&quot;"><strong>Morwell (*) (<span class=\"ptyred\">ALP 4.0%</span>)</strong></a> is based on the coal mining and electricity generation towns of the LaTrobe valley. The seat runs along the Princes Highway from Moe through Morwell to Traralgon and was held by Labor from 1970 to 2006 when it was won by the National Party's Russell Northe. Northe left the National Party in 2017 and was narrowly re-elected as an Independent at the 2018 election. Northe is retiring at the 2022 election so Morwell becomes a notional Labor seat based on a 2018 two-party preferred results. Labor's position has also been boosted by the addition of Moe in the redistribution. The major party candidates are Labor's Kate Maxfield, National Martin Cameron and Liberal Dale Harriman.</p>\r\n<p><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/\&quot;/news/elections/vic/2022/guide/shep/\&quot;"><strong>Shepparton (<span class=\"ptyblack\">IND 5.3% v LIB</span>)</strong></a> takes in most of the Greater Shepparton and Moira council areas. Independent MP Suzanna Sheed took this seat from the National Party in 2014, but has not built the sort of electoral buffer that rural Independents have developed across the Murray in NSW. Sheed will be opposed in 2022 by National candidate Kim O'Keeffe and Liberal Cheryl Hammer. The electorate has been badly hit by flooding in recent weeks.</p>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details open=\"open\">\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\n<h2 id=\"updates\">Page Updates</h2>\r\n</summary>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>17
